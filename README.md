# DBS-Project-19sw42-44-45-120
With this Project we can insert/update/delete record of newly enrolled Student/Teacher
and can save this data into the tables named 'student' & 'teacher' respectively also created by this project, in
Oracle database using SCOTT account of the user.
Moreover it can take attendance of three sections of 19SW batch students and save this in the table named
"Attendance" also created by the project. This attendance can be checked based on section-wise or rollno-wise
of the students. 
Also it shows the graph of a student's attendance, in addition to that it also tells percentage of attendance based on
total lectures conducted and it also tells that how much lectures a student should 
take in order to get minimum required attendance.
